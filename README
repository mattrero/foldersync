API allowing one-way synchronization from a source to a backup folder

To use it, you can use main class FolderSync with the following arguments.

 - For a one time synchronization : 
     <source_directory> <backup_directory>
  
 - For a real time synchronization :
     -rt <source_directory> <backup_directory>


You can also integrate it directly in your code.
 => In class FolderSync checks sync & realTimeSync methods.
